              The Service is offered for alpha and testing purposes, including on
              test networks. It may be unstable, incomplete, or unavailable at any
              time. Features, smart contracts, and economics may change or reset.
            </p>
            <p style={{ color: "var(--color-text-secondary)" }}>
              While the game is in alpha, in-game progress, match state, fleets, and
              other assets may be reset or lost on a regular basis as we deploy
              updates, migrate contracts, or wipe test data. You should not rely on
              any alpha state persisting.
            </p>
            <p style={{ color: "var(--color-text-secondary)" }}>
              The Service is intended for testing. Any tokens, items, or other assets
              you see or use in the test environment are for that environment only.
              They may be reset, deleted, or rendered unusable at any time, with or
              without notice. You use the Service at your own risk.
