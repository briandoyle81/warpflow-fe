# No em dashes in copy

- Do **not** use em dashes (`—`) in any UI text, headings, tooltips, labels, or documentation copy.

## Preferred alternatives

- Use a period: `Admiral. Your fleet is under attack.`
- Use a colon: `Admiral: your fleet is under attack.`
- Use a comma: `Admiral, your fleet is under attack.`
- Use parentheses: `Admiral (your fleet is under attack).`
- Use spaced hyphen when needed: `Admiral - your fleet is under attack.`

## Quick examples

- ❌ `Admiral—your fleet is under attack.`
- ✅ `Admiral, your fleet is under attack.`
