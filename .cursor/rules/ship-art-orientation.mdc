# Ship art orientation

When referring to ship art (rendered ship sprites, NFT art, SVGs):

- **Front** of the ship = **left side** of the art at native facing.
- **Rear** of the ship = **right side** of the art at native facing.

Use this when implementing flips, engine/glow placement, flee/retreat direction, or any logic that depends on which end of the ship is the nose vs the engines.
